2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pg/ip/p1d/outState_reg_LDC_i_1__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pg/ip/p1d/outState_reg_LDC_i_1__0/O, cell pg/ip/p1d/outState_reg_LDC_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pg/ip/p1u/outState_reg_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pg/ip/p1u/outState_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell pg/ip/p1u/outState_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pg/ip/p2d/outState_reg_LDC_i_1__2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pg/ip/p2d/outState_reg_LDC_i_1__2/O, cell pg/ip/p2d/outState_reg_LDC_i_1__2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pg/ip/p2u/outState_reg_LDC_i_1__1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pg/ip/p2u/outState_reg_LDC_i_1__1/O, cell pg/ip/p2u/outState_reg_LDC_i_1__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
